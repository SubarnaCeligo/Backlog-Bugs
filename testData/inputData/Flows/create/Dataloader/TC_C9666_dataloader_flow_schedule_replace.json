Other new packs had this same issue.  Also, changing the exciter didn't change the gate drive.  Max gate drive at 0W output was 28.5V pk-pk, out lower limit is 32V pk-pk.\",Intermittent oscillation in open load.  Gate drive drops below 19V pk-pk.,\"This unit was sent to engineering for a time to try to figure out this issue.  While the issue has not been resolved, engineering is still looking into this.  I was able to get a high enough gate drive by using an old test pack that I had.  Also replaced the rev D exciter for reliability.
