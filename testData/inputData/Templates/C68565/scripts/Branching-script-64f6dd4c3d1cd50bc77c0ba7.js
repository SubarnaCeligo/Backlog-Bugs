/*
* branchingFunction stub:
*
* The name of the function can be changed to anything you like.
*
* The function will be passed one 'options' argument that has the following fields:
*   'record' - object {} or array [] depending on the data source.
*   'settings' - all custom settings in scope for the router currently running.
* The function needs to return an array of integers representing the branch indices that should process the record.
* Throwing an exception will return an error for the record.
